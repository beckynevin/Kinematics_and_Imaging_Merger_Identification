# Goal
The goal of this repo is to pull all plateifu ids from MaNGA and run them through a code that extracts the RA, DEC, and SDSS information such as camcol, run, etc, in order to process the SDSS images.

# Data
My goal is to share publicly released MaNGA data here, so I will need to make sure that the dap version lines up with the most recent public data release (currently I am using dapall-v2_5_3-2.3.0.fits).
